# Connect 4 Two Player Game

Please find the first version of my Connect4 game at the link below
https://simeongluzman.github.io/Connect4-V1/

This is my first project built using React. So Far the game only supports a local two-player mode where players alternate placing their move on one device. 
V2 of this game will include a computer AI which will compete with a player with three dificulty modes (the third being unbeatable -- a perfect player will at best tie with the computer). This next version will be published shortly and will be implemented using an alpha-beta minimax algorithm.
